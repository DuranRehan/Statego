# STRATEGO

**Version 1.0.1**


**Game Rules**

The game rules follow the classic model of [Stratego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego).

Two players are required to play, one will be red, and the other will be blue. The red player will start at the beginning of each game, and it is a turn-based game.

The game is considered "partial information," meaning that a player does not have prior knowledge of the identity of the opponent's pieces.

__In comparison to the basic rules__:

* Continuously pursuing a piece is allowed.
* You are not required to implement the rule forcing you to attack an opponent's vulnerable piece.
* There is a debugging mode available that allows the identity of a piece previously revealed during combat to remain visible.
* The red and blue players must load their pieces from a file named red.txt and blue.txt, respectively.

The application is divided into two parts:
- Console
- Graphic
